" Unfortunately I do not have enough specific information about Seneca Scott's stances on the key issues to provide detailed scoring and reasoning. However, based on the limited information provided, here is my attempt at a high-level scoring:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Seneca Scott\",\n  \n  \"background\": {\n    \"score\": -20, \n    \"reasoning\": \"His background in labor organizing aligns somewhat with typical Democratic values, but his entertainment company background does not provide strong insight into his leadership skills or policy priorities.\"\n  },\n\n  \"platform\": {\n    \"score\": -60,\n    \"reasoning\": \"His focus on increased policing and surveillance is misaligned with this voter's support for community programs over law enforcement.\" \n  },\n\n  \"stance_on_key_issues\": {\n    \"score\": -50, \n    \"reasoning\": \"His generally skeptical stances toward policies supported by this progressive voter result in a poor alignment overall.\"\n  },\n\n  \"party_affiliation\": {\n    \"score\": 20,\n    \"reasoning\": \"His Democratic affiliation aligns with the voter's party, but his law-and-order stances are more typical of Republicans.\"\n  },\n\n  \"major_donors_and_endorsements\": {\n    \"score\": 30,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The Oakland NAACP endorsement provides some positive signal, but the lack of major donors makes his financial backing unclear.\"\n  },\n\n  \"local_reporting_and_coverage\": {\n   \"score\": -40,\n   \"reasoning\": \"The negative local coverage of his inflammatory rhetoric conflicts with the voter's likely desire for integrity.\"\n  },\n\n  \"track_record_of_integrity\": {\n    \"score\": -80,\n    \"reasoning\": \"His unfounded accusations and conspiratorial rhetoric demonstrate poor integrity and character.\"\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, Scott's alignment with this progressive voter's values appears very poor based on the available information. The negative scores reflect stances and rhetoric that conflict with the voter's likely priorities. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add."
