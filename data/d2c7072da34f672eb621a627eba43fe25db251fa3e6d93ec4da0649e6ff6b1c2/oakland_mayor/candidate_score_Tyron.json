" Here is my analysis of how well aligned Tyron Jordan's values and positions are with the voter's priorities:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Tyron Jordan\",\n  \n  \"background\": {\n    \"score\": 50,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Jordan has some relevant experience working in government and public service which aligns with the voter's support for public institutions. However, his background is not as directly relevant to major issues like the voter cares about.\"\n  },\n\n  \"platform\": {\n    \"score\": 80, \n    \"reasoning\": \"Jordan's focus on homelessness, small business, and public safety without criminalization matches the voter's progressive priorities around social services, justice reform, and helping those in need.\"\n  },\n\n  \"stance_on_key_issues\": {\n    \"score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Jordan's stances on affordable housing, homelessness, public safety staffing, and gun violence prevention generally align with the voter's progressive policy preferences, but lack specifics in some areas.\"\n  },\n\n  \"detail_on_key_issues\": {\n    \"affordable_housing\": {\n      \"score\": 60,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Jordan supports rental assistance and acquiring vacant properties which matches the voter's support for government intervention on housing, but lacks comprehensive plans.\"\n    },\n    \"homelessness\": {\n      \"score\": 80,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Jordan's plans for mini homes and improving encampments align very well with the voter's desire to help the homeless.\"\n    },\n    \"public_safety\": {\n      \"score\": 50, \n      \"reasoning\": \"Keeping police staffing as-is matches the voter's support for community programs over law enforcement, but the voter likely wants more reform.\"\n    },\n    \"violence_prevention\": {\n      \"score\": 70,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Restricting gun access matches the voter's progressive views, but lacks a comprehensive violence prevention plan.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \n  \"party_affiliation\": {\n    \"score\": 0,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Since Jordan is nonpartisan, I cannot assess how his partisan affiliation aligns with the voter's Democratic affiliation.\"\n  },\n\n  \"major_donors_and_endorsements\": {\n    \"score\": 0, \n    \"reasoning\": \"No major donor or endorsement information is available to judge alignment.\"\n  },\n\n  \"local_reporting_and_coverage\": {\n    \"score\": 0,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The limited local coverage provides insufficient information to assess alignment.\"\n  },\n\n  \"track_record_of_integrity\": {\n    \"score\": 0,\n    \"reasoning\": \"No relevant information found to evaluate Jordan's integrity.\" \n  }\n  \n}\n```\n\nIn summary, Jordan seems moderately well-aligned with this progressive voter based on his positions on homelessness, housing, public safety reform, and gun violence prevention. However, more comprehensive policy plans on the voter's major issues of interest would likely improve alignment. The lack of partisan affiliation, donor information, and local coverage makes it hard to fully evaluate alignment."
